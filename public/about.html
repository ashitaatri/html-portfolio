<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Ashita Atri, from the vibrant city of Gurgaon, India. My primary interests are in design and technology,
  where I combine creativity with technical expertise. I’ve built a strong foundation in creative problem-solving 
  and data analysis, which helps me explore innovative solutions and understand complex data patterns.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m not working, but I’m actively expanding my skills by learning tools like Java and SQL.
  This journey of self-improvement allows me to stay current with industry trends and enhance my technical abilities.</p>

<p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a passion for painting, cooking, and traveling.
   These hobbies not only provide me with creative outlets but also offer me new perspectives and
   inspiration. Whether it’s experimenting with a new recipe, exploring different cultures, or
   capturing the world through art, I find joy and inspiration in these activities.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects and experiences that reflect my journey. 
  If you’d like to connect or discuss ideas, I’d be delighted to hear from you!</p>
